## CROP RECOMMENDER

 This repository is for me to get familar with the implementation part of machine learning algorithms.
 Here the program predicts the most suitable crop from the targets specified based on the features.

 Targets : rice, maize, chickpea, kidneybeans, pigeonpeas, mothbeans, mungbean, blackgram, lentil, pomegranate, banana, mango, grapes, watermelon, muskmelon, apple, orange, papaya, coconut, cotton, jute and coffee

 Features : N, P, K, temperature, Humidity, pH and  rainfall. 


 This is also for me to get a brief idea for my first semester maths project which is on precision farming. I will add the link to the repository here.
